## üìò Project Overview

MicroTask is a web-based application that allows users to:
- Post tasks as employers.
- Apply for existing tasks as workers.
- Manage task applications (accept or reject).
- Notify users via email for critical task-related actions (e.g., application status updates).

The platform is designed to be modular and extensible, enabling future integration with advanced features like analytics and multilingual support.

## üñºÔ∏è Use Case Diagram

The following diagram outlines the main interactions between users and the MicroTask platform:

```plantuml
@startuml
actor Employer as E
actor Worker as W

rectangle "MicroTask System" {
    E --> (Post Task)
    W --> (Browse Tasks)
    W --> (Apply for Task)
    E --> (Review Applications)
    E --> (Accept/Reject Applications)
    (Accept/Reject Applications) --> (Send Email Notification)
    W --> (Receive Email Notification)
}
@enduml
```

To render this diagram, use a PlantUML-compatible viewer or tool (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA plugin, Visual Studio Code).
